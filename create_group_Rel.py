# We have to relate the groups of objects to extract important features
# e.g. we want to relate groups that have the same color, same number of objects, etc.
# Further, establish some causal relations between groups 
# Objects in group are rotations of objects in other group etc.
# This should basically be functions from obj_Rel applied to the whole group
# Maybe we can just directly lift these as unions
